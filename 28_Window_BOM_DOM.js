// The JavaScript code in a page has access to a number of objects. These objects can be divided into the following types:

// - Core ECMAScript objects
// - DOM: Objects that have to do with the currently loaded page (the page is also called the document)
// - BOM: Objects that deal with everything outside the page (the browser window and the desktop screen)


// The Window Object
// - The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.
// - All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
// - Global variables are properties of the window object.
// - Global functions are methods of the window object.
// - Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object
